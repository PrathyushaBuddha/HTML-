<h2><b>1.Cyber Security History</b></h2>
        <h3><i>In 1969, Leonard Kleinrock, professor of UCLA and student, Charley Kline, sent the first electronic message from the UCLA SDS Sigma 7 Host computer to Bill Duvall, a programmer, at the Stanford Research Institute. This is a well-known story and a moment in the history of a digital world.</i></h3>
        <h3><i>In 1970's, Robert (Bob) Thomas who was a researcher for BBN Technologies in Cambridge, Massachusetts created the first computer worm (virus). He realized that it was possible for a computer program to move across a network, leaving a small trail (series of signs) wherever it went. He named the program Creeper, and designed it to travel between Tenex terminals on the early ARPANET, printing the message "I'M THE CREEPER: CATCH ME IF YOU CAN."</i></h3>
        <h2><b>2.Types of Cyber Attacks</b></h2>
        <h3><i>A cyber-attack is an exploitation of computer systems and networks. It uses malicious code to alter computer code, logic or data and lead to cybercrimes, such as information and identity theft.Cyber-attacks can be classified into the following categories:</i></h3>
        <ol style="font-size:20px;">
        	<li>Web-based attacks</li>
        	<li>System-based attacks</li>
        </ol>
        <h2 style="font-size:20px;">1.Web-based attacks</h2>
        <h3><i>These are the attacks which occur on a website or web applications. Some of the important web-based attacks are as follows-</i></h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>Injection attacks</li>
        	<li>DNS Spoofing</li>
        	<li>Session Hijacking</li>
        	<li>Phishing</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="font-size:20px;">2.System-based attacks</h2>
        <h3><i>These are the attacks which are intended to compromise a computer or a computer network. Some of the important system-based attacks are as follows-</i></h3>
        <ul>
        	<li>Virus</li>
        	<li>Worm</li>
        	<li>Trojan horse</li>
        	<li>Backdoors</li>
        	<li>Bots</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><b>4.Challenges</b></h2>
        <h3><i>Today cybersecurity is the main component of the country's overall national security and economic security strategies. In India, there are so many challenges related to cybersecurity. With the increase of the cyber-attacks, every organization needs a security analyst who makes sure that their system is secured. These security analysts face many challenges related to cybersecurity such as securing confidential data of government organizations, securing the private organization servers, etc.</i></h3>
